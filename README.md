4. Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the 3 approaches.

The MVC Pattern is a reliable way to implement a software application making a good primary choice and starting point. Although, it can easily become too complex for small applications and too many updates can overwhelm the software, with the views not being able to keep up. The second method also allows for effective and simple dependency inversion but also has the possible disadvantage of being cumbersome with addition of too many interfaces. When it comes to the third method, the observers support the loose coupling principle between objects and can send data without making changes in the Subject or Observer classes. The only issue is if not handled properly, the observer can cause errors, slow down and overcomplicate the software.
